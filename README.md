# Jadis
Jadis is a simple **Ja**va bytecode **Dis**assembler written in Rust. The goal of this project is to recreate some of the functionality of the `javap` command.

Please note that Jadis is an educational project. This means that for any serious work, you should consider using the Java disassembler that came with your JDK.

## Goals
- [ ] Learn how Java's bytecode is structured.
- [ ] Parse JVM bytecode.
- [ ] Display information about bytecode.
- [ ] Recreate `javap` commands.
  - [ ] `-h`
  - [ ] `-v`
  - [ ] `-l`
  - [ ] `-public`
  - [ ] `-protected`
  - [ ] `-package`
  - [ ] `-p`
  - [ ] `-c`
  - [ ] `-s`
  - [ ] `-sysinfo`
  - [ ] `-constants`
  - [ ] `-m`
  - [ ] `-J`
  - [ ] `--module-path`
  - [ ] `--system`
  - [ ] `--class-path`
  - [ ] `-classpath`
  - [ ] `-cp`
  - [ ] `-bootclasspath`
  - [ ] `--multi-release`

## Usage rights
Since this project is purely an educational project, I have decided to open-source everything and release it under the MIT license.

All I am asking you is to give me some credit if you end up using (parts of) this code in your own projects.

Happy hacking! ðŸ˜Š
